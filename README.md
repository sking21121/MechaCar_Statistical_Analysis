# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

# Purpose
AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing
team’s progress. My purpose is to provide data analytics that may help the production team and to review the production
data for insights.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.

-Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

-Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

-Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not? 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots. 
The following PSI metrics for each lot: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation

The suspension coil’s PSI continuous variable across all manufacturing lots

-The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?



## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers.
