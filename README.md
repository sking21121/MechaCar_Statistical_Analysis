# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

# Purpose
AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing
team’s progress. My purpose is to provide data analytics that may help the production team and to review the production
data for insights.

Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.

Written Summary
-Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

-Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

-Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
